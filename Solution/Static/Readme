All executable files require python3 interpreter

Required Libraries:
	numpy,
	pandas,
	sklearn,
	joblib,
	matplotlib,
	csv,
	sys,
	re,
	pathlib,
Feature Extracting:
	File: static_malware.py
	Additional required files:All the Malware Analysed Raw Data
	Execute this file to find all the features and API present with respect to malware(Result saved to file_mal_api_1.csv and 		file_mal_feat_1.csv)
	
	File: static_benign.py
	Additional required files:All the Benign Analysed Raw Data
	Execute this file to find all the features and API present with respect to benign(Result saved to file_ben_api_1.csv and 		file_ben_feat_1.csv)	

	File: static_full.py
	Additional required files:  file_mal_api_1.csv , file_ben_api_1.csv , file_mal_feat_1.csv , file_ben_feat_1.csv
	Execute this file to combine the features and get the top 120 API based on frequency(Result saved to file_top_120.csv)	
		
Training Phase:
	File: staticAnalysis.py 
	Additional files required:All the Benign and Malware Analysed Raw Data
	Execute the file to extract the features from benign and malware data and then saves it into StaticAnalysis.xlt

	File: staticAnalysis_train.py
	Additional required files: StaticAnalysis.xlt 	-	Data file
	Execute the file to train the model and store the additional objects required to make predictions on testdata.

Testing Phase:
	File: static.py
	Additional required files: 
		Malware and Benign Files, its path	-	Test Data file
		model				        -	model saved during training phase
	Ensure the staticAnalysis_train.py is executed at least once, otherwise static.py may throw error (Additional objects saved during 		training phase are required here.)
	Place your test data files at one place and specify its path to the file static.py
	Execute static.py to make predictions (Results are saved to the file static.csv).
