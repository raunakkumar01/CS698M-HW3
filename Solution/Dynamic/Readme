All executable files require python3 interpreter

Required Libraries:
	numpy,
	pandas,
	sklearn,
	joblib,
	matplotlib,
	csv,
	sys,
	re,
	pathlib,


Training Phase:
	File: dynamicAnalysis.py 
	Additional files required:All the Benign and Malware Analysed Raw Data
	Execute the file to extract the features from benign and malware data and then saves it into DynamicAnalysis.xlt

	File: DynamicAnalysis_train.py
	Additional required files: DynamicAnalysis.xlt 	-	Data file
	Execute the file to train model and store the additional objects required to make predictions on testdata.

Testing Phase:
	File: Dynamic.py
	Additional required files: 
		Malware and Benign test Files, its path	-	Test Data file
		model				        -	model saved during training phase
	Ensure the DynamicAnalysis_train.py is executed at least once, otherwise dynamic.py may throw error (Additional objects saved during training phase are required here.)
	Place your test data files at one place and specify its path to the file dynamic.py
	Execute dynamic.py to make predictions (Results are saved to the file dynamic.csv).
